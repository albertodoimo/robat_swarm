Welcome to SonoRo_swarm's documentation!
===================================

**SonoRo_swarm** is a robotic swarm framework designed to run on the SonoRo robotic platform, supporting research and active sensing applications.

Overview
--------

SonoRo_swarm enables researchers and developers investigate bio-inspired swarm robotics behaviour using the SonoRo robotic platform. The framework supports active sensing mechanisms and collective intelligence patterns.

Features
--------

- Attraction and repulsion dynamics
- Extensible architecture for custom behaviors
- Active sensing capabilities
- Data collection for post processing and analysis

Quick Start
-----------

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
